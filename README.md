# LithiumNukerV2 - GitHub Repository README 🚀
 
## Description
 
Welcome to the LithiumNukerV2 GitHub repository! LithiumNukerV2 is a powerful Discord bot tool that comes with a range of features designed to enhance your Discord server management experience. This tool was initially developed as a free and open-source project, but unfortunately, some individuals have chosen to commercialize it by selling it for $50-60.

## Why We Share It 🤝
 
The initial purpose behind creating LithiumNukerV2 was to contribute to the Discord community by offering a free and open-source tool that could simplify server management. It was meant to empower server administrators, foster collaboration, and improve the overall experience for Discord users. However, the unfortunate trend of selling this tool for a profit goes against the spirit of open-source software.
 
We want to emphasize that the version being sold by some individuals is based on our original work and has been modified without our involvement. We strongly believe that open-source projects should remain free and accessible to everyone, and we encourage users to respect the principles of open-source software.
